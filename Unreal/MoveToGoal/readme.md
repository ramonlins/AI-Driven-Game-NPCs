Unreal does not have a linux plugin to training agents, so I am trying to create a simple form to do this.

The main codes are in ***Source*** folder, they are:
- Agent.h and Agent.cpp;
- SocketClient.h and SocketClient.cpp;
- ObservationCollector.h and ObservationCollector.cpp;

All the files will be dependent of the <AgentScript> like MoveToGoal.h and MoveToGoal.cpp;
