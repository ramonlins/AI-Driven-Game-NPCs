# Move to Goal Project

Welcome to the "Move to Goal" project, a basic exploration of artificial intelligence and game development. In this Unity-based problem, I've created a simple learning environment for our non-player character (NPC) using the ML-Agents toolkit. The primary objective of this project is to train an intelligent NPC to navigate and move towards a predefined goal within the game world.

## About

The NPC was trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) through reinforcement learning techniques, it gathers experience, makes decisions, and refines its abilities over time. As it interacts with its surroundings, it gradually comprehends the concept of spatial awareness and optimal paths. The main goal is to have the NPC autonomously reach its target.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Unity project and explore the assets and scripts.
3. Train or run the project to use the NPC learning process or observe its goal-oriented movement.

## Usage

- For training the NPC or running the project, please refer to the documentation in the project folders.
- Feel free to experiment and modify the project to further develop the NPC's capabilities or apply it to your own game.
